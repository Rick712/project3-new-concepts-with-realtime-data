## About this project

For project 3 I had to make a web app for De Ceuvel: 'De Ceuvel is a city playground for innovation and creativity. An experiment in which we try to make sustainability tangible, understandable and fun.'

De Ceuvel has a new project: Aquapolics. They created a closed system consisting of multiple organisms. In this system, there are multiple sensors that track a ton of values. De Ceuvel wants a web app that uses the data from the sensors.

This is just a prototype of something that could be a large web app. There are a lot of functionalities that I would want to implement (see the wishlist).

## My concept

To me, the system of the Aquapolics is very interesting. I love biology, but there wasn't any data yet, since the system was relatively new, and not yet fully operational.

What I think is really interesting, is that there are a lot of things that could go wrong in the system. This is what my concept is based around. When a user navigates to the website, it gives information about the system. When the 'tutorial' has ended, the user has the opportunity to change the values. The user directly sees what impact the change has made to the system.
